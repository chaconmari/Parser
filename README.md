# Parser

I encountered a few problems when trying to find alternatives from Java language to PHP, such as Enumerations and Hash Maps. For the Enumeration alternative, I decided to make the variables constant in the Token class. For the Hash Map, I realized that in PHP the arrays are associative which is what is needed for Hash maps. Also, coming from Java I was loving the freedom PHP allows, but ended up having a lot of syntax problems in the end because of it. For example, I had an array called ‘values’, but while coding, I would sometimes put it down accidently put it down as value (without the s). When I would run it, it of course wouldn’t work properly and it took a while to figure out why. Another example was when I figured out that I had to use ‘$this->’ and having to go back and change them all. This led to a lot of tedious debugging. Another problem I encountered was that I used my own hard coded program input (copied and pasted from the URL) so I could work from home. Then when I tried to switch it to grab the text from the URL, it didn’t work. Not because of the URL, but because of all the spaces. To fix this, after getting all the text from the URL, I used a function to get rid of all but one whitespace.
